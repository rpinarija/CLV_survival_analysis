# CLV_survival_analysis

Understanding the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is pivotal for businesses, offering insights into revenue forecasting, retention strategies, and product performance. In this project, I analyze sales data for a construction management software company to estimate CLV.

While CLV is typically derived from historical data, its accuracy may vary, especially for startups or companies with incomplete sales records. To address this, I employ survival analysis—a predictive technique leveraging censoring—to better assess the value of newer customers who could potentially become long-term clients.
